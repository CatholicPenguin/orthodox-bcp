\lett{I}{believe}, O Lord, and • I confess * that thou art truly the Christ, the Son of the • Living God,\par
\secondline{Who didst come into the world to save • sinners, * of whom • I am first.}
\thirdline{And I believe that this is truly thine own immaculate • Body, * and that this is truly thine own • precious Blood.}
Wherefore I pray thee: have mercy • upon me * and forgive my transgressions both voluntary and in • voluntary,\par
Of word and of deed, of knowledge and of • ignorance. * And make me worthy to partake without • condemnation\par
Of thine immaculate • Mysteries, * unto the remission of my sins and unto life ever • lasting. Amen.\\
\par
\lett{O}{f} thy Mystical Supper, O • Son of God, * accept me today as a • communicant;\par
\secondline{For I will not speak of thy • Mystery * to thine • enemies,}
\thirdline{Neither will I give thee a kiss as • did Judas; * but like the thief will I • confess thee:}
Remember • me, * O Lord in • thy Kingdom.\\
\par
\lett{N}{ot} unto judgement, nor unto condemn • ation, * be my partaking of thy holy • Mysteries,\par
\secondline{O Lord, but unto • the healing * of soul • and body.}
