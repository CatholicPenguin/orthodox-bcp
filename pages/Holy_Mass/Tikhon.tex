%If any be an open and notorious evil liver, or have done any wrong to his neighbours by word or deed, so that the Congregation be thereby offended; the Curate, having knowledge thereof, shall call him and advertise him, that in any wise he presume not to come to the Lord’s Table, until he have openly declared himself to have truly repented and amended his former naughty life, that the Congregation may thereby be satisfied, which before were offended; and that he have recompensed the parties, to whom he hath done wrong; or at least declare himself to be in full purpose so to do, as soon as he conveniently may.

%The same order shall the Curate use with those betwixt whom he perceiveth malice and hatred to reign; not suffering them to be partakers of the Lord's Table, until he know them to be reconciled. And if one of the parties so at variance be content to forgive from the bottom of his heart all that the other hath trespassed against him, and to make amends for that he himself hath offended; and the other party will not be persuaded to a godly unity, but remain still in his frowardness and malice the Minister in that case ought to admit the penitent person to the Holy Communion, and not him that is obstinate.

%There is a dispute between the Missals as to where to place the Collect for Purity and the Summary of the Law. The St. Tikhon's Liturgy (as it exists) and the English Missal place it at the Altar, after the Ascent. While this is a fitting place for the Collect, it creates a liturgical novelty for the Summary of the Law. At the Epistle side is offered the prayers to God: the various propers and the sacrifice of the Epistle. In contrast, the Summary of the Law is not directed towards God (who needs no preaching of His own Law) but rather towards the people. Therefore, it is absurd to have the place of sacrifice to God (the Epistle side) be the place of exhortation to the People of God, especially if does not even turn towards the Congregation. There is an example where the Priest does fully turn away from God towards the Congregation: the \emph{Orate Frates}, which occurs in the middle of the Altar. Therefore, to avoid novelties and liturgical inconsistencies, I have placed the Collect and the Summary/Decalogue at the Foot of the Altar, as other Missals have so done (it is appropriate for the Collect, for that is where other collects are read, and it is supremely expedient for an exhortation of the People).
\subby{Collect for Purity}
\begin{rubric}
    The Priest, at the Foot of the Altar, saith the Collect for Purity, as followeth, in an audible voice.
\end{rubric}
\lett{A}{lmighty} God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid; Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy Name; through Christ our Lord. \textit{Amen.}
\begin{rubric}
Then shall the Priest, turning to the People, rehearse distinctly---in an audible voice---The Ten Commandments; and the People, still kneeling, shall, after every Commandment, ask God mercy for their transgressions for the time past, and grace to keep the law for the time to come.
\end{rubric}
\begin{rubric}
And \textsc{Note,} that in rehearsing the Ten Commandments, the Priest may omit that part of the Commandment which is inset.

\begin{rubric}
	The Decalogue may be omitted. But \textsc{Note,} That when ever it is omitted, the Minister shall say the Summary of the Law, beginning, \emph{Hear what our Lord Jesus Christ saith.}

%This is a difficult situation to discern. The Prayer Book Traditions reflects the uncertainty as to where to place the Confession. The current American placement is reflective of Cranmer's Protestant theology and liturgical sense, since the origins come from placing the Confession close to the reception of Communion (which was immediately after the Words of Institution). The 1928 reflects a more catholic understanding of the liturgy, including the epiklesis and the other integral parts of the Eucharistic Sacrifice before the Reception of Holy Communion. This understanding was more present in the 1549 which placed the Confession in a congruous place as the Roman tradition: after the Sacrifice and before the Communion of the Faithful. While this is obscured here due to the Byzantine devotion imposed, this is only a temporary imposition and the overall shape of the liturgy (due to the Orthodox theology present here) is better preserved in its Catholic and even Prayer Book form by placing the Confession immediately before the `Ecce Agnus Dei', which is where the Second Confiteor would go in the Roman Rite.

%The Book of Common Prayer has always contained rubrics at the beginning and end of the liturgical text in order for the good order of the Church. Due to the unique situation of the Vicariate, it is fitting that these be accommodated to our use.
%\begin{rubric}
%Notwithstanding anything that is elsewhere enjoined in any Rubrick or Canon, the Priest, in celebrating the Holy Communion, shall wear the vestments proper to the Priest as of 1950 in dissident Rome. That is, Amice, Alb, Cincture, Maniple, Stole, and Chasuble (the latter three of the colour of the day).
%\end{rubric}
\begin{rubric}
    It is expedient for the Priest to have, set up on the Altar, cards with the most common prayers (or at least a convenient pamphlet), including the those only mentioned by their incipit in this Book.\par
\end{rubric}
%\begin{rubric}
%The Priest, the presence of an Ordinary notwithstanding, when he processes or reposes, wears a Canterbury Cap or Biretta.
%\end{rubric}
%\begin{rubric}
%There shall be no celebration of the Lord's Supper without at least one person, other than the Priest, physically present.
%\end{rubric}
\begin{rubric}
The Altar, at the Communion-time---having a fair white linen cloth, a cross, and at least two candles upon it---shall stand in the Sanctuary.
\end{rubric}
\begin{rubric}
The Bread for the Eucharist ought to be provided by the Priest or the members of the Congregation. It must be leavened. That is, before and after being initially baked, it must be made of---and only made of---wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt. The Wine should be made of grapes, without any additives or supplements. The Cup for the Eucharist should be made of precious metal.
\end{rubric}
\begin{rubric}
It is an ancient and laudable rule of the Church to receive this Holy Sacrament fasting. That is, one who desireth to receive the Eucharist must consume neither food nor drink (water excepted) from the midnight before the liturgy until the time of reception. In the case of Masses which occur after noon, it is sufficient that the fasting begin at noon or immediately after one's noon-time meal.

%\lett{D}{early} beloved in the Lord, ye who mind to come to the holy Communion of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, must consider how Saint Paul exhorteth all persons diligently to try and examine themselves, before they presume to eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart and lively faith we receive that holy Sacrament; 
%Addition:
%that is, the very and true Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ; 
%
%so is the danger great, if we receive the same unworthily. Judge therefore yourselves, brethren, that ye be not judged of the Lord; repent you truly for your sins past; 
%Addition:
%confess them to your spiritual father; 
%
%have a lively and steadfast faith in Christ our Saviour; amend your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men; so shall ye be meet partakers of those holy mysteries. And above all things ye must give most humble and hearty thanks to God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the world by the death and passion of our Saviour Christ, both God and man; who did humble himself, even to the death upon the Cross, for us, miserable sinners, who lay in darkness and the shadow of death; that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end that we should always remember the exceeding great love of our Master, and only Saviour, Jesus Christ, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits which by his precious blood-shedding he hath obtained for us; he hath instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as pledges of his love, and for a continual remembrance of his death, to our great and endless comfort. To him therefore, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, let us give (as we are most bounden) continual thanks; submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will and pleasure, and studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness all the days of our life. Amen.

%	When the Minister giveth warning for the Celebration of the Holy Communion, (which he shall always do upon the Sunday, or some Holy-day, immediately preceding,) he shall read this Exhortation following, or so much thereof as, in his discretion, he may think convenient.
%\end{rubric}
%\lett{D}{early} beloved, on \textit{N.} day next I purpose, through God's assistance, to administer to all such as shall be religiously and devoutly disposed the most comfortable Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; to be by them received in remembrance of his meritorious Cross and Pas-sion; whereby alone we obtain remission of our sins, and are made partakers of the Kingdom of heaven. Wherefore it is our duty to render most humble and hearty thanks to Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for that he hath given his Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, not only to die for us, but also to be our spiritual food and sustenance in that holy Sacrament. Which being so divine and comfortable a thing to them who receive it worthily, and so dangerous to those who will presume to receive it unworthily; my duty is to exhort you, in the mean season to consider the dignity of that holy mystery, and the great peril of the unworthy receiving thereof; and so to search and examine your own consciences, and that not lightly, and after the manner of dissemblers with God; but so that ye may come holy and clean to such a heavenly Feast, in the marriage-garment required by God in holy Scripture, and be received as worthy partakers of that holy Table.
%
%    The way and means thereto is: First, to examine your lives and conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are not only against God, but also against your neighbours; then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make restitution and satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being likewise ready to forgive others who have offended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offences at God's hand: for otherwise the receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing else but increase your condemnation. Therefore, if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime; repent you of your sins, or else come not to that holy Table.
%    
%    And because it is requisite that no man should come to the holy Communion, but with a full trust in God's mercy, and with a quiet conscience; 
    %This phrase is omitted so to indicate that all such sinners ought to confess:
    %therefore, if there be any of you, who by this means cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further comfort or counsel, 
%    let him come to me, or to some other Priest of 
    %Change:
%    Christ's Church, confessing his sins and opening his grief; that he may receive such godly counsel, advice, and absolution of his sins as may tend to the quieting of his conscience, the removing of all scruple and doubtfulness, and the sure benefit of Jesus Christ's promise: the remission of sins and bestowing of the benefits of his Passion.
%\begin{rubric}
%	Or, in case he shall see the People negligent to come to the Holy Communion, instead of the former, he may use this Exhortation.
%\end{rubric}
%\lett{D}{early} beloved brethren, on \textit{N.} I intend, by God's grace, to celebrate the 
%Change:
%Holy Sacrifice of the Mass: 
%
%unto which, in God's behalf, I bid you all who are here present; and beseech you, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so lovingly called and bidden by God himself. Ye know how grievous and unkind a thing it is, when a man hath prepared a rich feast, decked his table with all kind of provision, so that there lacketh nothing but the guests to sit down; and yet they who are called, without any cause, most unthankfully refuse to come. Which of you in such a case would not be moved? Who would not think a great injury and wrong done unto him? Wherefore, most dearly beloved in Christ, take ye good heed, lest ye, withdrawing yourselves from this holy Supper, provoke God's indignation against you. It is an easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate, because I am otherwise hindered with worldly business. But such excuses are not so easily accepted and allowed before God. If any man say, I am a grievous sinner, and therefore am afraid to come: wherefore then do ye not repent and amend? 
%Addition:
%Wherefore do ye not approach myself or one of Christ's Priests for Confession and Absolution? 
%
%When God calleth you, are ye not ashamed to say ye will not come? When ye should return to God, will ye excuse yourselves, and say ye are not ready? Consider earnestly with yourselves how little such feigned excuses will avail before God. Those who refused the feast in the Gospel, because they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of oxen, or because they were married, were not so excused, but counted unworthy of the heavenly feast. Wherefore, according to mine office, I bid you in the Name of God, I call you in Christ's behalf, I exhort you, as ye love your own salvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion. And as the Son of God did vouchsafe to yield up his soul by death upon the Cross for your salvation; so it is your duty to receive the Communion in remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, as he himself hath commanded: which if ye shall neglect to do, consider with yourselves how great is your ingratitude to God, and how sore punishment hangeth over your heads for the same; when ye wilfully abstain from the Lord's Table, and separate from your brethren, who come to feed on the banquet of that most heavenly food. These things if ye earnestly consider, ye will by God’s grace return to a better mind: for the obtaining whereof we shall not cease to make our humble petitions unto Almighty God, our heavenly Father.
