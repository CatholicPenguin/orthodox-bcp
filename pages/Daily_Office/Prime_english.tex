\lett{N}{ow} that the daylight fills the sky,\par
\secondline{We lift our hearts to God on high,}\par\noindent
That he, in all we do or say,\par\noindent
Would keep us free from harm to-day:\\
\par\noindent
Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;\par\noindent
From anger's din would hide our life;\par\noindent
From all ill sights would turn our eyes,\par\noindent
Would close our ears from vanities:\\
\par\noindent
Would keep our inmost conscience pure;\par\noindent
Our souls from folly would secure;\par\noindent
Would bid us check the pride of sense\par\noindent
With due and holy abstinence.\\
\par\noindent
So we, when this new day is gone,\par\noindent
And night in turn is drawing on,\par\noindent
With conscience by the world unstained\par\noindent
Shall praise his name for victory gained.\\
\par\noindent
All laud to God the Father be;\par\noindent
All praise, eternal Son, to thee;\par\noindent
All glory, as is ever meet,\par\noindent
To God the holy Paraclete. Amen.\\
